"""MARGE Protocol Requirement (custom BeeAI Requirement).

3-agent architecture rules (Chat Agent + ML Orchestrator + Expert):

  A. consult_ml_orchestrator is gated on consult_medical_expert being
     called first. The expert frames clinical context; the Chat Agent
     then decides which ML conditions to evaluate.
  B. clinical_report (terminal) needs consult_ml_orchestrator AND
     consult_medical_expert in the trajectory.
  C. abstain (terminal) needs consult_medical_expert at least once.
  D. request_more_info (terminal) is always allowed.

Natural-language chat (no tool call) remains a valid turn ending for
casual conversation. The prompt steers the model toward using structured
terminals for clinical analysis.

Helper functions `has_any_ml_prediction` and `has_consulted_expert` are
exposed for tests and for ad-hoc inspection of an agent state.
`has_any_ml_prediction` matches `consult_ml_orchestrator` in addition to
any legacy `predict_*` tools.
